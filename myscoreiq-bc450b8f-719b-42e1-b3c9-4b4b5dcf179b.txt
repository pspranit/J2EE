Having made substantial payments on mortgage and/or non-mortgage installment loans is seen as lower risk. As installment loan balances decrease, they have less impact on a FICO® Score. Note, having a low installment loan balance to loan amount ratio is considered slightly less risky than having a 0% installment loan ratio.
